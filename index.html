										<h2>Our Testimonials</h2>
										<hr>
										<p>"I engaged Tony from Passion For Classics to restore my 1967 Humber Super Snipe, which had been broken down for about 25 years.
I couldn't have wished for a better experience. Tony has done everything 'right'
He's kept me informed of progress (including by sending photographs) and contacted me to discuss any issues.
He explains everything clearly, and has always welcomed me coming to the workshop to see the progress on my car.
I'm impressed by the quality of the work and Tony's determination to get things spot on.  It's comforting to know that underneath the shiny paint there's quality metal repairs and anti-rust treatments. 
In my case I didn't want to just hand my car to him and get it back restored, I was keen to research, choose and track down specific items and parts eg particular carpet, certain tyres. Tony was willing to accept my input and work with me.  
Knowing that budget was an issue for me, on several matters he recommended the best way a job should be done, but also presented a cheaper option.
 
As well as his professionalism he's also friendly.  
 
I particularly value Tony's honesty and integrity. These can make the difference between a quality restoration and losing your precious car - as I know from a previous experience taking another car to another restorer before I met Tony. I got my car back as a mostly painted shell with some parts missing (a better result than some other customers). I'm now hoping to take this car to Tony too."</p>
										<hr>
										<p>"I was first introduced to Tony Passion for Classics through a good friend.  The introduction is as important as a blind date, you really need to trust the person you’re going to hand over your prized possession to. 
 
Mine is a 1970 Chevelle 454 Big Block.  On the surface she looked ok.  To the trained eye, Tony knew exactly what was needed to restore her to a reliable drivable car.   
 
Tony put together a meticulous quote, having gone over everything in detail and time has proven him right.  Along the journey there were only a very few unexpected surprises, none too serious, and none to falter Tony on his mission.  The quality of workmanship is beyond peer and I have no hesitation at all to recommend you to Tony at Passion for Classics if you have a project too." </p>
										<hr>
										<p>"I found Passion for Classics a couple of years ago just after they opened and I am so glad I did.
Tony’s passion for his work and looking after his customers is not difficult to see.
It’s in his positive, ‘can do’ attitude, his attention to detail, experience and the obvious care and pride he takes in his work.
Tony did an A1 restore on my 1963 EH Holden and worked within my budget. The results were amazing.  
Since then Tony has also taken on the regular servicing and mechanical work of my fleet of company staff vehicles.
Again reliable, honest, thorough, well priced and friendly service you just can’t beat.
